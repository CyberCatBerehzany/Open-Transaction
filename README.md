**Open Transaction** is a website designed to increase trust and transparency for charitable organizations.

For users, the service will be free, while a subscription system will be implemented for the charitable funds.

There will be several subscription plans, each offering its own features:

<ul>
<li>Ukrainian: Integration with Ukrainian banks.</li>

<li>European: Integration with European banks.</li>

<li>International: Integration with international banks.</li>
</ul>

Initially, the information will be sourced from social media posts. In the future, it is planned to integrate directly with the payment system (via API, webhooks, etc.). The obtained information will be recorded on the Blockchain.

On the main page of the website, the user will be able to select the fund that interests them, and blocks containing transaction information (date, amount, recipient, etc.) will appear. At the bottom of the page, there will be links for contacting us.

It is also planned that the main page will include links to the websites of the funds that will be partnering with us.

Currently, the website is built using HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap. In the near future, we plan to integrate React.
